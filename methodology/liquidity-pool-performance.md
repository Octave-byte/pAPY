# ðŸ’± Liquidity pool performance

## What is a liquidity pool ?

Liquidity pools are sums of money blocked on smart contracts intended to serve as liquidity to people who wish to exchange tokens on decentralized protocols.

## Rewards and liquidity

The performance of a liquidity pool depends on its utilization rate.

Indeed, the fees generated on a liquidity pool are fixed. Multiplying these fees by the volume of activity of a day, divided by the total average volume over a day (utilization rate) gives the daily performance (APR) of a pool.

## Impermanent loss



Impermanent losses occur when you provide tokens to a liquidity pool (LP) and the price of the tokens changes. The larger this gap between the price of the deposit token and the current price, the more you are exposed to non-permanent losses. In this case, this loss means that you will get less money by placing than by keeping the money out of the pool. We will integrate a built-in IL calculator on the targeted pools.
