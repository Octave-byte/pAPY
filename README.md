# ðŸ‘´ What is pAPY ?

**pAPY** is a platform that promotes accurate, neutral and in-depth statistics for the decentralised finance non-degens. We offer reliable historical APY and TVL for a maximum of strategies (yield, farming, liquidity, lending) on a almost exhaustive list of protocols.&#x20;

### Why ?

As a financier, it is crucial to benchmark between different opportunities before making investment decisions. Today in DeFi it is impossible to do this for several reasons&#x20;

* The method used by the DeFi protocols to calculate their performance is never the same (instantAPY, monthlyAPY, weeklyAPY, APR, Gross/Net)&#x20;
* We have almost no information on the historical performance of these pools and the evolution of the APY over time
* It is difficult to compile the information of all the protocols given the number of strategies on each of them.

While as a degen these issues are not big obstacles, they are irritating as a boomer in your attempt  to make rational investment decisions.



We propose with pAPY to rethink the method of calculating performance, detailing the numbers so as to compare carrots to carrots.
